# Sign-Language-Prediction

Sign language recognition is a project that uses technological breakthroughs to help those who are visually impaired. We intended to construct a sign detector for this reason. We are attempting to recognize and display messages based on hand movements with this project. The advancement of existing technologies, as well as extensive study, are employed to help the deaf and dumb. Because comprehending sign language is not something that many people have, this can be highly valuable for deaf and dumb people connecting with others. Python modules such as OpenCV, Tensorflow, and Keras are needed to complete this project.
